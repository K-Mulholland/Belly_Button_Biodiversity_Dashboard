Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

In this project, I built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset used for this project: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The interactive dashboard includes 4 points of information:

Test Subject ID Number with Demographic Information


Wash Frequency (Per Week)


Microbial Species (OTUs) Found Within The Given Sample


Sample Values (How Much Of Each OTU Was Present)
